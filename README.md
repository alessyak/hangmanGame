# Hangman Game in Python

This project was developed as part of "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023" on Udemy, taught by Dr. Angela Yu.

## Description:
The Python Hangman Game is an interactive console-based game where players attempt to guess a randomly selected word letter by letter. The game provides visual feedback through a hangman art display, and players have a limited number of lives to guess the correct word.

## Features:
1. Random Word Selection:
 The game selects a random word from a predefined list for each round.
2. Visual Feedback:
 The game provides visual feedback on the player's progress through a hangman art display that evolves with each incorrect guess.
3. Lives System:
 Players start with a set number of lives (default: 6) and lose a life for each incorrect guess.
4. Duplicate Guess Check:
 The game checks if the player has already guessed a letter and provides feedback accordingly.
5.Game End Conditions:
 The game ends when the player correctly guesses the word or runs out of lives.

## How to Play:
- Clone the repository or download the script.
- Run the script in a Python environment.
- Follow the prompts to guess letters and try to discover the hidden word.
- The hangman art display will update based on correct and incorrect guesses.
- Continue guessing until you either correctly identify the word or run out of lives.

### Note:
Customize the hangmanWords.word_list to include your own words for an added personal touch.
